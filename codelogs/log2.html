        <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
        <p>When working with CSS, we use units to measure how big we want certain elements to be.
            Without these, CSS would not know what it's supposed to mean, so they're pretty important.
            Theres a lot of units we can use, divded into two catagories; absolute, and relative.</p>
        <p><b><i>But what is the difference between these catagories??</i></b></p>
        <p>Good question, conveinent voice of the audience; that's the
            <code>{ pt }</code> of this code log.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="two">
        <h2>Absolute Units</h2>
        <p>An absolute unit represents a unit that will remain consistent no matter the size of your
            screen or any other factors. It's a conventional unit of measurement.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="b">Pixels <code>{ px }</code>
                <ul class="no">
                    <li>Pixels are one of the most common units developers use, and one of the
                        smallest. A single pixel consists of only 1/96th of an inch. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="b">Points <code>{ pt }</code>
                <ul class="no">
                    <li>Points are slightly larger than pixels, consisting of 1/72nd of an inch.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="b">Inch <code>{ in }</code>
                <ul class="no">
                    <li>An inch is the unit of measurement that the common man is most familar with.
                        Its length consists of 10/10ths of an inch.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="b">Picas <code>{ pc }</code>
                <ul class="no">
                    <li>Picas are a unit of measurement that I had never heard of before now, but
                        they are 1/6th of an ich long. The more you know!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="three">
        <h2>Relative Units</h2>
        <p>Relative units are used to scale an element's size relative to the page it is on. It scales
            to the width of the screen you are using, so it's very useful for mobile-destop compatability.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="b">Viewport Width <code>{ vw }</code>
                <ul class="no">
                    <li>Viewport width scales the width of the element to a given percent of the size
                        of the viewport. <code>{ 1vw } </code> would mean the element scales to 1% of the
                        total length of the page. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="b">Viewport Height <code>{ vh }</code>
                <ul class="no">
                    <li>Viewport height is exactly like viewport width, but scaling for height instead.
                        <code>{ 1vh }</code> would scale an element to 1% of the height of the page.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
