    <h1> Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags </h1>
    <p>Semantic tags in HTML are specfic tags meant to convey what they contain
        with more accuracy than just the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. At first, these tags are
        indistigushable from each other, but this can be changed with CSS. It's up to the coder to
        decide how they look. They can also be utlized by screen readers.
    </p>
    <p>Here's some examples of different types of semantic tags, and what their intended
        purpose is:
    </p>

    <textarea cols="110" rows="13">
<header> I'm at the top of the page! </header>

<nav> I can take you places! </nav>

<section> I'm an important section of text! </section>

<article> I hold information like a magazine! </article>

<aside> I'm not as inportant, but I can be used to enhance the information in a seperate section! </aside>

<footer> I'm at the bottom of the page! </footer>
    
    </textarea>

    <p>A nonsemantic HTML tag is a tag that cannot be utlized by a screen reader, and does not define
        a specifc layout of the page. examples of these are the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags.
    </p>
    <p> The benefits of semantic tags over nonsemantic tags are their compatability with screen
        readers, and ease of coding as you can easily tell exactly what information belongs in what
        section, and what the purpose of each section is.
    </p>
